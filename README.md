# [project]ion

A low-poly, Viewfinder-inspired photo-projection puzzle, built in Unity 6.3 (URP) for the browser.

**Play:** https://derprito64bit.github.io/play/?zone=game (desktop browser, keyboard and mouse)

Hold up a photo, line it up and place it. The world inside the photo's view is cut away, and the scene in the photo becomes real, walkable geometry.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD / Mouse / Space | Move / look / jump |
| 1–9 or Wheel | Choose photo |
| Hold Shift, then LMB | Hold up the photo, then place it (holding the right mouse button also raises it; Settings can make Shift a toggle) |
| Q / E (hold) | Rotate the raised photo smoothly; tap to nudge |
| E | Press a button, pick something up |
| R | Rewind the last change, anytime (it also saves you from a fall) |
| R R (quickly) | Back to the last checkpoint |
| C | Instant camera (Shift to aim, LMB to shoot) |
| Esc | Pause and open the settings |

One click on the loading card starts the game with the mouse captured. After Esc, the browser needs about a second before it lets the game capture the mouse again; the pause card shows when it is ready.
