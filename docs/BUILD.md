# Building [project]ion

Unity **6000.3.25f1** (6.3 LTS) with the **Web Build Support** module. Everything below runs
from the repo root (which is also the Unity project root).

```bash
UNITY=/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.3.25f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity
```

On **Windows**, `scripts/ion.ps1` wraps every command below (it finds the pinned editor, waits for
Unity correctly, prints test totals and exits non-zero on failure):

```powershell
powershell -File scripts/ion.ps1 setup -Twice   # first setup; later runs: setup
powershell -File scripts/ion.ps1 test           # EditMode + PlayMode (or test-edit / test-play, -Filter <name>)
powershell -File scripts/ion.ps1 build          # Web build to Build/Web (build-dev for a development build)
powershell -File scripts/ion.ps1 serve          # http://localhost:8080/
```

Only one Unity process may have the project open at a time. Close the editor before running
batch-mode commands; each command is its own invocation.

## 1. Project setup (once, and after changing setup code)

Creates `Assets/Settings/URP-Ion.asset` (+ renderer, Forward path, MSAA 4x, HDR off, one shadow
cascade), assigns it to Graphics/Quality settings, includes the Ion shaders, sets layers
8 `Player` and 9 `PhotoUI`, sets the Player/Web settings, sets Active Input Handling to the Input
System package, and regenerates `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity` (one `GameBootstrap` object).

```bash
"$UNITY" -batchmode -nographics -quit -projectPath . \
  -executeMethod Ion.EditorTools.ProjectSetup.Run -logFile -
```

The first time, run it **twice**. The first run may happen before every package has
imported, and changing *Active Input Handling* only takes effect after the editor restarts.
Both runs should end with `[Ion] Project setup finished OK.` In the editor, the same action is
under the menu **Ion → Setup Project**.

## 2. Tests (EditMode)

```bash
"$UNITY" -batchmode -nographics -projectPath . \
  -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults Build/test-results.xml -logFile -
```

(Do not pass `-quit` with `-runTests`.) The exit code is non-zero if a test fails. The results
are written to `Build/test-results.xml`.

## 3. Web build

```bash
"$UNITY" -batchmode -nographics -quit -projectPath . -buildTarget WebGL \
  -executeMethod Ion.EditorTools.WebBuild.Build -logFile -
```

- The output goes to `Build/Web` (`index.html`, `Build/`, `TemplateData/`). Pass `-ionOutput <dir>` to change it.
- `Ion.EditorTools.WebBuild.BuildDev` makes a development build (with a profiler connection and readable stack traces).
- The exit code is non-zero on failure. The build also refuses to run if `Ion.Levels.GameBootstrap` is missing.
- `-buildTarget WebGL` avoids a platform switch partway through the method. Without it, the build switches the target itself, which is slower.
- In the editor, the same builds are under **Ion → Build Web** and **Ion → Build Web (Development)**.

Settings that matter for the web build: Compression *Disabled* (GitHub Pages gzips on the fly),
Data Caching on, Exceptions *None*, Strip Engine Code, Managed Stripping *High* (with
`Assets/Plugins/WebGL/link.xml` preserving `Ion.Runtime`), IL2CPP *Optimize for size*, Code
Optimization *Disk Size with LTO* (`UnityEditor.WebGL.UserBuildSettings.codeOptimization`, re-applied
by every `WebBuild` run because it lives in `Library/`; LTO makes the link step slower), DXT
textures, WebGL2 only, and the custom template `PROJECT:Ion` (`Assets/WebGLTemplates/Ion`).

### Debug harness (`?debug=1`)

`Ion.DebugTools.IonDebug` (teleport, give all photos, place / rewind / snap from the browser console via
`window.ionUnity.SendMessage('IonDebug', ...)`) always runs in the Editor and in PlayMode tests. In a
Web player it only installs when the page URL has `?debug=1`, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/?debug=1`.
Automation scripts must append it.

Rewind has two paths too. `Rewind` / `Rewind2` are instant (`WorldHistory.RewindOnce` / `RewindToCheckpoint`: the
solvability tests use them). `RewindPress` is one real press of R (`RewindController.PressRewind`: the glide back with its
desaturation, tape bands, vignette, tape sound and returning photo; two presses within 0.35 s escalate to the checkpoint),
and `Rewind2Press` the real R R. `TimeScale("0.25")` slows a transition down for screenshots (`TimeScale("")` = 1).

Placement has two paths. `Place` is immediate: the whole cut and paste lands in one frame, which is what the
solvability tests use. `PlacePress` is the player's LMB path. The press-in holds the view still with the raised
photo covering exactly the frustum. Behind it, `ProjectionSystem.BeginStagedPlace` spreads the cuts, the paste
and the collider cooking over the next frames, at most `StageBudgetMs` (6 ms) per frame and nearest first.
While that runs, an original's collider stays on until its cut piece's collider has been cooked. The swap
(`CommitStagedPlace`, which raises the `Placed` event) happens when the work is done. A press cancelled by R,
by lowering the photo or by a restart undoes the staged placement silently. `PlacePress` logs the begin
frame's cost and then the maximum staged work per frame and the cost of the swap.

### Pointer lock and input (manual checklist)

The page owns the pointer lock (`Assets/WebGLTemplates/Ion/index.html` + `Assets/Plugins/WebGL/IonPointerLock.jslib`;
Unity reads it through `Ion.Gameplay.PointerLock`). Check in Chrome, Edge and Firefox on macOS and Windows:

- Fresh load: one click on the loading card's "Click to play" starts the game locked; that click never raises, places or presses.
- Esc, then click within a second: nothing happens (no error loop); the pause card's bar fills, then one click resumes.
- Hold Shift (photo up), alt-tab away and back: the photo is down, and a held Shift must be released before it raises again.
- Space / arrow keys / Tab never scroll the page or move focus away from the game.
- The settings card (after Esc) can be clicked without capturing the mouse; the end card's "Play again" re-captures it in the same click.

The PlayMode tests `RewindTests` and `SwitchTests` (Lead D) build their own small world and simulate the lock
(`PointerLock.Simulate`) and the raise / click devices (`IonInput.UseSimulatedDevices`).

## 4. Serve locally

```bash
scripts/serve-web.sh            # http://localhost:8080/
PORT=9000 scripts/serve-web.sh  # another port
```

Open the page in desktop Chrome. Append `?dpr=2` to the URL to render at full Retina resolution.
Graphics tiers (Settings card after Esc, or `IonDebug.Quality` with `?debug=1`): Low / Med / High / Ultra / Auto.
Ultra (local lights, 2-cascade soft shadows, HDR bloom, extra detail) is described in the art bible §6.3.1.
By default the device pixel ratio is capped at 1.5 for frame rate.

## 5. CI / GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/web.yml` uses GameCI (`game-ci/unity-builder@v6`) to run setup and then
`WebBuild.Build`. It uploads `Build/Web` with `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and deploys it
with `actions/deploy-pages`. The workflow runs **manually** (`workflow_dispatch`) until these
repo secrets are set:

- `UNITY_LICENSE`: the contents of the `.ulf` file, for Personal
- or `UNITY_SERIAL`: for Pro
- `UNITY_EMAIL` and `UNITY_PASSWORD`

Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its source. The target URL is
`https://vasiniks.github.io/project.ion/`. All asset paths in the template are relative, so
the sub-path works.

## Troubleshooting

- **Keyboard and mouse do nothing in Play mode.** Active Input Handling has not switched yet. Re-run the setup, then restart the editor.
- **The scene is pink or magenta.** The URP asset is not assigned, or the Ion shaders were not included. Re-run the setup and check the log for `Required shader ... not found`.
- **`Type 'Ion.Levels.GameBootstrap, Ion.Runtime' not found`.** `Ion.Runtime` has compile errors. Fix them, then re-run the setup.
